IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Extract ALL mentioned skills, degrees, and certifications.
2. Format all list items as lowercase strings unless it's a proper noun like a certification name (e.g., keep "AWS Certified Solutions Architect" as is, but "python" should be lowercase).
3. Prioritize accuracy and completeness for all fields.
4. Calculate total experience years carefully if possible.

Respond ONLY with the valid JSON object. Do not include explanations or introductory text. Ensure the output is a single, valid JSON structure.
