Analyze the following job description and extract the key information into a valid JSON object.
Be precise and extract information ONLY from the provided text.

The JSON object MUST have the following keys:
- "required_skills": [List of essential technical skills, programming languages, software, or tools explicitly mentioned as REQUIRED. Example: ["python", "sql", "api design"]]
- "preferred_skills": [List of skills mentioned as PREFERRED, desired, nice-to-have, or a plus. Example: ["react", "cloud formation"]]
- "domain_expertise": [List of specific industry domains or specialized knowledge areas mentioned (e.g., "e-commerce", "healthcare analytics", "supply chain"). Empty list [] if none mentioned.]
- "soft_skills": [List of interpersonal or behavioral skills mentioned (e.g., "communication", "teamwork", "problem-solving"). Empty list [] if none mentioned.]
- "required_education": [String describing the minimum education level required (e.g., "Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science", "Master's Degree or equivalent experience"). Use "Not Specified" if not mentioned.]
- "required_experience_years": [String describing the minimum years of relevant experience (e.g., "3 years", "5+ years", "3-5 years"). Use "Not Specified" if no specific number of years is mentioned. Focus on extracting the NUMBER of years.]
- "essential_requirements": [List of specific certifications, licenses, security clearances, or other non-negotiable qualifications mentioned. Example: ["AWS Certified Solutions Architect", "Security Clearance TS/SCI"]. Empty list [] if none mentioned.]

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1.  **Accuracy is key.** Extract information directly present in the text. Do not infer or add information not present.
2.  **Experience Years:** Focus specifically on the number of years required for the `required_experience_years` field. If the text mentions experience but gives no number (e.g., "Experience with databases"), the value should be "Not Specified".
3.  **Education:** Capture the degree level and field if mentioned for `required_education`. If only "related field" is mentioned, use that. If nothing is mentioned, use "Not Specified".
4.  **Skills:** Differentiate carefully between explicitly REQUIRED skills and PREFERRED skills based on the wording. Technical skills go in `required_skills` or `preferred_skills`. Industry knowledge goes in `domain_expertise`. Interpersonal skills go in `soft_skills`.
5.  **Essentials:** Only include explicitly stated mandatory items like specific certifications or clearances in `essential_requirements`.
6.  **Format:** Ensure all list items are strings. Use lowercase for skills unless it's a proper noun (like a specific technology name or certification). Ensure the final output is ONLY the JSON object.

Respond ONLY with the valid JSON object. No explanations, apologies, or introductory text before or after the JSON.
